# Zazu.js
*Voice communication client in Node.js*

## What is Zazu.js ?
Zazu.js is a project started by me (Thomas Viau) in order to have a JavaScript-based client for vocal communications like Mumble or Teamspeak without any installation required for the client.

## Usage
#### Install packages
```
npm install
```

#### Run server
```
make
```
You can use *make http* or *make https*

#### Access in browser
Browse to `http://localhost/` or `http://<ip/url_of_your_server>/` to use Zazu.
